# Unit Four Software Engineering

A software process is a set of activities that leads to the production of a software product. 



These activities may involve the development of software from scratch in a standard programming language like Java or C.



Increasingly, however,new software is developed by extending and modifying existing systems and by configuring and integrating off-the-shelf software or system components.



Software processes are complex and, like all intellectual and creative processes, rely on people making decisions and judgements.



Because of the need for judgement and creativity, attempts to automate software processes have met with limited success.



Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools can support some process activities.However, there is no possibility, at least in the next few years, of more extensive automation where software takes over creative design from the engineers involved in the software process.



One reason the effectiveness of CASE tools is limited is because of the immense diversity of software processes. 



There is no ideal process, and many organisation have developed their own approach to software development. 



Processes have evolved to exploit the capabilities of the people in an organisation and the specific characteristics of the systems that are being developed. 



For some systems, such as critical systems, a very structured development process is required.



For business systems, with rapidly changing requirements, a flexible, agile process is likely to be more effective.



Although there are many software processes, some fundamental activities are common to all software processes:



1. Software specification  The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined.
2. Software design and implementation  The software to meet the specification must be produced.
3. Software validation  The software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants.
4. Software evolution The software must evolve to meet changing customer Needs.



Although there is no 'ideal' software process, there is scope for improving the software process in many organisations. 



Processes may include outdated techniques or may not take advantage of the best practice in industrial software engineering. 



Indeed, many organisations still do not take advantage of software engineering methods in their software development.



Software processes can be improved by process standardisation where the diversity in software processes across an organisation is reduced. 



This leads to improved communication and a reduction in training time, and makes automated process support more economical.



Standardisation is also an important first step in introducing new software engineering methods and techniques and good software engineering practice. 



1.Software process models



A software process model is an abstract representation of a software process.



Each process model represents a process from a particular perspective, and thus provides only partial information about that process. 



In this section. I introduce a number of very general process models (sometimes called process paradigms) and present these from an architectural perspective.  That is, we see the framework of the process but not the details of specific activities.



These generic models are not definitive descriptions of software processes.



Rather,they are abstractions of the process that can be used to explain different approaches to software development.



 You can think of them as process frameworks that may be extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes.



1. The waterfall model This takes the fundamental process activities of specification, development, validation and evolution and represents them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing and so on.
2. Evolutionary development  This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development and validation. An initial system is rapidly developed from abstract specifications. This is then refined with customer input to produce a system that satisfies the customer's needs.
3. Component-based software engineering  This approach is based on the existence of a significant number of reusable components. The system development process focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing them from scratch.



2.The waterfall model



The first published model of the software development process was derived from more general system engineering processes (Royce, 1970).



 Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known as the waterfall model or software life cycle. The principal stages of the model map onto fundamental development activities:



1. Requirements analysis and definition  The system's services, constraints and goals are ,established by consultation with system users. They are then defined in detail and serve as a system specification.
2. System and software design  The systems design process partitions the requirements to either hardware or software systems. It establishes an overall system architecture. Software design involves identifying and describing the fundamental software system abstractions and their relationships.
3. Implementation and unit testing  During this stage, the software design is realised as a set of programs or program units. Unit testing involves verifying that each unit meets its specification.
4. Integration and system testing  The individual program units or programs are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software requirements have been met. After testing, the software system is delivered to the customer.
5. Operation and maintenance  Normally (although not necessarily) this is the longest life-cycle phase. The system is installed and put into practical use. Maintenance involves correcting errors which were not discovered in earlier stages of the life cycle, improving the implementation of system units and enhancing the system's services as new requirements are discovered.
