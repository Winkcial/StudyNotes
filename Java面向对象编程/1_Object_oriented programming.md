## Constructing Object Using Constructors

A constructor is invoked to create an object using the `new` operator.

Constructors play the role of initializing objects.

Constructor is a special kind of method. They have three peculiarities:

- A constructor must have the same name as the class itself.
- Constructors do not have a return type (not even void).
- Constructors are invoked using the `new`  operator when an object is create.

Like regular methods, constructors can be overload (i.e., multiple constructors can have the same name but different signatures. ), making it easy to construct object with different initial data values.
