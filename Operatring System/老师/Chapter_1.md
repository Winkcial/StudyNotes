# Chapter 1

## Applications

Complex applications must:

- run for weeks or months;
- properly release resources to avoid waste;
- cope with outrageously malicious user input;
- recover from errors and continue running.

## POSIX

Protable Operating System Interface(POSIX):

- an important step toward producing reliable applications;
- POSIX compliant systems no longer need to contend with small but critical variations in behavior of library functions across platforms.

## Objectives

- Learn how OS manages resources;
- Experiment with buffer overflows;
- Explore concurrency and asynchronous behavior;
- Strengthen basic OS terminology;
- Understand serious implications of incorrect code.

## Asynhronous Operation

- Computer system events occur at unpredictable times an in unpredictable order;
- Programs must work for all possible orderings.
