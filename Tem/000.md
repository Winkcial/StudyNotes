With the rapid development of urbanization, a large number of people are flooding into big cities to seek for a better life, which inevitably brings these city dwellers some serious challenges.

Three main challenges are worth mentioning. Firstly, the cost of living in big cities is much higher than that in small ones. High housing prices in big cities force people to pay an arm and leg for a small apartment distant from downtown area. Secondly, in fast-paced big cities big cities, people have to confront heavy workload and fierce competition. Lastly, due to economic growth and the improvement of living conditions, the number of private cars is surging quickly in big cities, which results in air pollution and heavy traffic.

in my opinion, though city dwellers are facing more and more challenges, it's not an excuse for them to back down. They should at first to improve the psychological quality, and face up to the fact with a positive attitude. Then they need to strive to strengthen their own capabilites to adjust to the city life.
