# Identifiers

**Identifiers** are the names that identify the elements such as classes, methods, and variables in a program.

All identifiers must obey the following rules:

- An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, underscores(_), and dollar signs($).
- An identifier must start with a letter, an underscores(_), or a dollar sign($). It cannot start with a digit.
- An identifier cannot be a reserved word.
- An identifier cannot be true, false, or null.
- An indentifer can be of any length.

Note

- Since Java is case sensitive, area, AREA and Area are all different identifiers.
- Do not name identifiers with the $ character. By convention, the $ character should be used only in mechanically generated source code.
